{"name":"Zork-like Game","tagline":"","body":"### Game History\r\n\r\n_“This is so boring… Every day the same. Go to class, take the same subway line, and listen to these stupid’s teachers. Once the clock reaches 2 o’clock, the same journey back home. Take the subway, go to my home building and take the leaver… The half of every day is wasted without anything exciting and once I’m home, the routine of every day… warm the meal, wash the dishes, and do the homework. And finally, some distraction playing the some of the few games I got on the PC. Just to argue with my mum when they arrive home because she says I’m always playing games. THIS SUCKS. After that just go dinner and sleep, just to wake up early and start again the same shit. I wish I was alone and don’t have to do the same every day…_\r\n\r\n_What time is it? It’s so shiny to be early morning. What happen with the alarm clock? ‘Click’ ‘click’. What’s happening here why the light isn’t working? Wait… My phone is turned off too. Mum? Dad? They aren’t here… I’m alone?_\r\n_‘Bip’’Bip’. What’s that? Seams there’s something in my PC screen… A message?”_\r\n\r\nThe story is based in a strange phenomenon that Marc, a 19 years old student that lives in Barcelona, experimented. He was tired of the same routine and wishes to be alone and do what he pleases, but sometimes, your dreams can become true and your worst nightmare.\r\n\r\nYou are in the skin of Marc, you wake up in your bedroom and realize you are alone and any type of technology isn’t working. The only thing you find is a message in your PC screen that introduce you to this mystery. A mystery that will make you visit some of the most important places of the city to solve it and escape from this nightmare.\r\n\r\nThe mystery you are experimented is based in Gaudi’s world. The dragon statue disappeared from Parc Güell and you must find it to scape.\r\n\r\nIn order to do that you must find the 7 pieces of the dragon hidden in the map.\r\n\r\nThe body is inside a piano in the Liceu theatre. The head is inside a crown in the Montjuic palace. The tail is in a chest hidden in Parc de la Ciutadella and the paws are in Camp Nou (under players bench), Sants (hidden in the dark tunnels), a car (in Plaça Glories) and in Sagrada Familia (where the bag hanging from the tower isn’t maybe the more strange thing). \r\n\r\nTo get this parts, you will need the Liceu key hidden in one of the cars surrounding Plaça Glories and the Montjuic palace key, hidden in the violin bag inside Liceu (museum directors like all type of art). But first of all, you will need your home key to exit home.\r\n\r\nBe careful to not enter the dark tunnels of station without light or maybe you will get scared. To reach the hanging bag in Sagrada Familia you need to throw something like one of the balls from the net full of balls that was in Camp Nou. And when you got all the pieces maybe take some cement from the harbour to put them together is not a bad idea.\r\n\r\nBut remember! You are still human and you need to eat healthy food to be able to continue your journey! So you will find different types of meal in different places (tip: remember to cook it!).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Game Map\r\n\r\n![Game Map](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Trodek/Zork-like-Game/master/zorklike%20map.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe names and multipliers between two places represents de number of steps you must do to go from a place to another.\r\n\r\n### Objects\r\n\r\nRoom: PC screen message, wardrobe, lantern and batteries (inside wardrobe)\r\n\r\nKitchen: cereals, knife, water\r\n\r\nParents Room: wardrobe, home key and condom box (inside wardrobe)\r\n\r\nSagrada Familia: bag, drake paw (inside bag)\r\n\r\nPlaça Glories: cars (blue, red, yellow, green, white, black), Liceu key (inside car (random one)), drake paw (inside car (also random))\r\n\r\nParc de la ciutadella: chest (hidden in the fountain (only visible with lantern)), drake tail (hidden inside the chest)\r\n \r\nHarbour: cement, ship, shrimps (inside ship)\r\n\r\nLiceu: Piano, popcorn, violin bag, Monjuic key (inside violin bag), drake body (inside piano)\r\n\r\nPlaça Catalunya: meat, fish, potatoes, salad\r\n\r\nMontjuic Palace: crown, drake head (hidden in the crown)\r\n\r\nSants: chocolate bar, drake paw (only visible if lantern is on)\r\n\r\nCamp Nou: bench, drake paw (under bench), net full of balls (must be cut with the knife)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Special Feature\r\n\r\nThe special feature will be the hungry, as you move for the map every 2 steps you will use 1 food, you start with 10 food and the meal you find gives different amount of food.
