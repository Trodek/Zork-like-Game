Go to class, take the same subway line, and listen to these stupid’s teachers. Once the clock reaches 2 o’clock, the same journey back home. Take the subway, go to my home building and take the leaver… The half of every day is wasted without anything exciting and once I’m home, the routine of every day… warm the meal, wash the dishes, and do the homework. And finally, some distraction playing the some of the few games I got on the PC. Just to argue with my mum when they arrive home because she says I’m always playing games. THIS SUCKS. After that just go dinner and sleep, just to wake up early and start again the same shit. I wish I was alone and don’t have to do the same every day…</em></strong>

<p>This is a Zork-like game (text-based). You are in the skin of Marc, you wake up in your bedroom and realize you are alone and any type of technology isn’t working. The only thing you find is a message in your PC screen that introduce you to this mystery. A mystery that will make you visit some of the most important places of the city to solve it and escape from this nightmare.</p>
