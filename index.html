Go to class, take the same subway line, and listen to these stupid’s teachers. Once the clock reaches 2 o’clock, the same journey back home. Take the subway, go to my home building and take the leaver… The half of every day is wasted without anything exciting and once I’m home, the routine of every day… warm the meal, wash the dishes, and do the homework. And finally, some distraction playing the some of the few games I got on the PC. Just to argue with my mum when they arrive home because she says I’m always playing games. THIS SUCKS. After that just go dinner and sleep, just to wake up early and start again the same shit. I wish I was alone and don’t have to do the same every day…</em>

<p>The story is based in a strange phenomenon that Marc, a 19 years old student that lives in Barcelona, experimented. He was tired of the same routine and wishes to be alone and do what he pleases, but sometimes, your dreams can become true and your worst nightmare.</p>

<p>You are in the skin of Marc, you wake up in your bedroom and realize you are alone and any type of technology isn’t working. The only thing you find is a message in your PC screen that introduce you to this mystery. A mystery that will make you visit some of the most important places of the city to solve it and escape from this nightmare.</p>

<p>The mystery you are experimented is based in Gaudi’s world. The dragon statue disappeared from Parc Güell and you must find it to scape.</p>

<p>In order to do that you must find the 7 pieces of the dragon hidden in the map.</p>

<p>The body is inside a piano in the Liceu theatre. The head is inside a crown in the Montjuic palace. The tail is in a chest hidden in Parc de la Ciutadella and the paws are in Camp Nou (under players bench), Sants (hidden in the dark tunnels), a car (in Plaça Glories) and in Sagrada Familia (where the bag hanging from the tower isn’t maybe the more strange thing). </p>

<p>To get this parts, you will need the Liceu key hidden in one of the cars surrounding Plaça Glories and the Montjuic palace key, hidden in the violin bag inside Liceu (museum directors like all type of art). But first of all, you will need your home key to exit home.</p>

<p>Be careful to not enter the dark tunnels of station without light or maybe you will get scared. To reach the hanging bag in Sagrada Familia you need to throw something like one of the balls from the net full of balls that was in Camp Nou. And when you got all the pieces maybe take some cement from the harbour to put them together is not a bad idea.</p>

<p>But remember! You are still human and you need to eat healthy food to be able to continue your journey! So you will find different types of meal in different places (tip: remember to cook it!).</p>
